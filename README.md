# Introduction
Basic Chrome Native Messaging Terminal For Executing Non-interactive Command

Keywords: Node.js, Native Message, Chrome Extension

# Origin
After migrating to chromium from chrome, I find that Chromium does not support H.264 codec, therefore many video-sharing and livestream websites(such as www.bilibili.com) are disabled. 

[mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) is a cli program for playing local and online video(youtube-dl) which support a wide variety of codecs. To save the time that I have to copy the url to terminal every time I open video websites, I develop this extension.
